## Abstract
KOBConnect is the digital wallet application. The users can use it to store credentials and can access these stored credentials with ease. The wallet application is going to come with basic set of authentication to provide security for the user.
## Dependent Projects

## Motivation
The mobile applications are the most convenient and compatible tool everything now a days. KOBConnect is a moblile application which helps people in Kochi to access their own data in a centralized manner. The Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) are a new type of globally unique identifier designed to enable individuals generate their own identifiers using systems we trust, and to prove control of those identifiers (authenticate) using cryptographic proofs like digital signatures.
## Status of the Project
Incubation
## Solution
 It will collect the digital credentials and store them in the wallet. And it will establish a pairwise unique connections using public-private DID key pairs. And the data are protected as well as it only share the pieces of data the user want to share in zero-knowledge, instantly under the user's consent. That means the data is purely protected and no one can easly access it.
